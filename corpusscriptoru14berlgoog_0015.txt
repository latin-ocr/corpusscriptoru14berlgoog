»The name and situation of the emperor John
Cantacuzene might inspiro the most lively curio-

sity. His memorials. of forty years extend from

the revolt of the younger Andronicus to his own ⁸

ahdioetion of the empire, audit is observ-ed, that,

like Moses and Caesar, he was ‘the principal ao- ,

tor in the soenes which he describes. But in this
Α 'eloquent work, we should vainly seek 'the sin-
cerity „of an hero-or· a penitent. Retired in a
cloyster from the vices and passione of the world
he proeents not a confession, but an apology. 'of
¹the ,lise of an ambitious statesman. Instead of
nnsoldjng the true counsels and, characters of men,
he displays the smooth and specious sut-face of
events , highly varnished with his own praises and
those of his friends. Their ’ motives are always
pure 3 their ends always legitimate ε they conspire
and rebel without any views of interest3 and the
violence which they inflict or suffer is celebrated¹
as the spontaneous effect of reason and virtue«
